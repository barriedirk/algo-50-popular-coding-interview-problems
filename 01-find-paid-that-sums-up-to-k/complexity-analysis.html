And in a hash table, inserting, searching, and removing have an O(1) cost in average, so:</p><p>T(n) = n*O(1) = O(n)</p><p><strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(n)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the worst case, every element needs to be inserted in the hash table, this case happens when each element is unique and we don't find a pair that sums up to k. And we have n elements, the extra space would be n, so:</p><p>S(n) = O(n)</p><p>Note that we can also use a set instead of a hash table, we get the same time and space complexity</p></div></div></div></div>
