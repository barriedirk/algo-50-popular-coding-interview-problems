We consider an element as peak if it's greater than or equal to its neighbors, the next and previous element (assume that arr[-1] and arr[n] are equal to -8). And if there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Input: arr = [4, 5, 8, 3]</p></li><li><p>Output: 2</p></li><li><p>Explanation: arr[2] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[1], and greater than or equal to arr[3]</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]</p></li><li><p>Output: 4</p></li><li><p>Explanation: arr[4] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[3], which is it's only neighbor</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Input: arr = [1, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3]</p></li><li><p>Output: 3</p></li><li><p>Explanation: arr[3] is a peak element because it's greater than or equal to arr[2] and greater than or equal to arr[4] (other valid outputs would be 1 and 4, because arr[1] and arr[4] are also peak elements)</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="instructions--drag-handle--ocDGT"></div></div>
