                <p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>
                <p>We put n = length of str</p>
                <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(n²)</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The outer loop is repeated n times, the inner loop is
                    repeated i times, and what's inside the inner loop costs
                    O(1) because we just compare characters and eventually
                    return a character
                </p>
                <p>Cost of iterations of the outer loop:</p>
                <p>1st iteration -&gt; i = 0</p>
                <p>2nd iteration -&gt; i = 1</p>
                <p>3rd iteration -&gt; i = 2</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>nth iteration -&gt; i = n-1</p>
                <p>
                    The sum is 0+1+2+...+(n-1), it's the sum of integers from 0
                    to n-1, which is equal to n(n-1)/2
                </p>
                <p>
                    T(n) = n(n-1)/2 = (n²-n)/2 = n²/2 - n/2, we take the
                    greatest term, we remove the constant, and we get a time
                    complexity of O(n²)
                </p>
                <p><strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(1)</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We're just using two integer variables i and j, the extra
                    space is 2, it's a constant
                </p>
                <p>S(n) = 2 = O(1)</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p><strong>Solution 2:</strong></p>
                <p>We put n = length of str</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The loop is traversing characters of str, so it does n
                    iterations, and at each iteration, we are searching for a
                    key in the hash table and eventually inserting a value. And
                    in a hash table, inserting, searching, and removing have an
                    O(1) cost in average, so:
                </p>
                <p>T(n) = n*O(1) = O(n)</p>
                <p><strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(n)</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In the worst case, every character needs to be inserted in
                    the hash table, this case happens when each character is
                    unique and we don't find a repeating character. And we have
                    n characters, the extra space would be n, so:
                </p>
                <p>S(n) = O(n)</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>
                    Note that we can also use a set instead of a hash table, we
                    get the same time and space complexity
